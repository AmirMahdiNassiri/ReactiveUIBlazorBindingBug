# ReactiveUIBlazorBindingBug
This repo contains a minimal source project to reproduce a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/2932) reported for the [ReactiveUI.Blazor](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) package ([NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReactiveUI.Blazor)).

I genuinely appreciate the work done by the authors of [ReactiveUI](https://www.reactiveui.net) and their built-in [support for Blazor](https://www.reactiveui.net/docs/getting-started/installation/blazor). Thanks for making the life of a Blazor developer easier! Cheers üçª #_+
